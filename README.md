# skeleton-states-example

This is a code sample that shows skeleton states in React. This is a sample application that uses fake NBA awards voting data and creates a mini application. 

This project does not use redux. I wanted to simplify the examples and avoid boilerplate. 

Instructions for pulling down the project. 

Step 1.) Clone the project: 

```
git clone https://github.com/rcavezza/skeleton-states-example
```

Step 2.) Go into the project and npm install dependencies: 

```
cd skeleton-states-example
npm install
```

Step 3.) Start the server: 

```
npm start
```

Notes on the application. In this current version, the areas with voter data are all implemented using skeleton states. The areas with player data are all implemeneted using full page spinners. In the future, I may create a branch where I take the player data and skeleton states for those pages. 

This project was first demo'd at Boston Code Camp on November 18, in Burlington, MA.

There is a live demo hosted on heroku at https://pacific-meadow-91348.herokuapp.com/
